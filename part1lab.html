        <b>The Gravedigger's Wife</b>
    </h1>
    <p>
        In Djibouti City in the Horn of Africa, Guled (Omar Abdi) is among a group of men who eke out a meager living burying the bodies that are delivered to a local hospital.
      <p>
        When his beloved wife Nasra (Yasmin Warsame) contracts a kidney infection, the couple finds themselves in dire straits as a transplant is financially out of reach. Pragmatic Nasra resolves to enjoy her remaining days with her husband and son, but Guled cannot let her go—and he resolves to do the one thing in his power to save her from her fate. A poetic ode to the unshakable bond the couple share, The Gravedigger’s Wife finds great beauty in sorrow and in the grand gestures and tender moments between two people deeply in love.

    In The Gravedigger’s Wife, Finnish Somali writer-director Khadar Ayderus Ahmed observes the long, arduous lengths love can reach to. His poetic debut is a study of slowing time to capture the ceremonial element in the act of caring for another, where the smallest moments mark the most radiant demonstrations of reverence. Mesmeric cinematography and an impactful score make for an unforgettable journey into regional landscapes rarely appreciated in the popular cinema of Europe or the Americas, and even rarer viewed on Somali terms. In that way, perhaps what Ahmed offers is more than a love story and rather a visual lesson in story as love.
